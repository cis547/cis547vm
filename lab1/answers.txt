Answer the questions in this file after running AFL, IKOS and Gemini on the
all the C programs. The questions are organized into two parts: Part A
concerns with the performance of the tools on programs,
and Part B concerns with the nature of the tools itself.

Part A: Follow the below instructions to fill in the table below.

Each of the C programs contains zero or more division instructions.

First, inspect the code of each program, and fill in its ground truth
(right/wrong) in the Ground Truth column:

- right if the program does not contain any divide-by-zero errors.
- wrong if the program contains a divide-by-zero error.

We've given you the ground truth for programs 10 and 11.

Next, refer to the logs of each analyzer's run on each program, and fill
in its result (accept/reject) in the respective column:

- accept if your analyzer does not report any divide-by-zero errors.
- reject if your analyzer reports a (potential) divide-by-zero error.

Lastly, use the above computed results to calculate Precision, Recall,
and F-Measure scores for each analyzer on this suite of programs.
